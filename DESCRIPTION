Description: The Predictive Adjusted Capped Estimator (PACE) is a deterministic 
  hybrid growth-based forecasting method that combines year-over-year, rolling 
  quarter-over-quarter, and prior-quarter growth signals. The method applies 
  fixed asymmetric caps and optional seasonal scaling to produce stable and 
  interpretable multi-step forecasts. The package includes tools for one-step 
  and multi-step forecasting, seasonal adjustment, benchmarking, and simulation.
